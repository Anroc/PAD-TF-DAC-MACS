\subsection{Summary}
In the past sections we evaluated the path from the classical rekeying scheme to multi-authority attribute based encryption. We reviewed different more performant topics in secure group communication and arguet why attribute based encryption might be a more sutable scheme. Finally, we noticed that multi-authority attribute based encryption might be more suitable for secure cloud storage systems. In this subtopic we ended up with TF-DAC-MACS which finally satisfies all the requirements and provides acceptable scalability. 

In comparison to the classical rekeying scheme we expect better performance on en- and decryption and much better performance when scaling up the number of users. It must be said that the performance improvments of ABE in comparison to RSA depend on the selected use case. If group will be formed that can be described completly by an attribute set ABE will surly be more efficient. If groups are created that are not that easy describale with a defined attribute set, ABE will eventually perform at least as good as the current scheme. 

Wheather this hold true in practice and if the day-to-day use cases of the user are suffient to provide the promised performance boost will be evaluated in the following sections.
