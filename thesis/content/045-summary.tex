\section{Summary}
In the past sections the path from the classical rekeying scheme to multi-authority attribute based encryption was evaluated. Different topics in secure group communication were reviewed and the direction of why attribute based encryption might be a more suitable scheme was motivated. Finally, it was shown that multi-authority attribute based encryption is more appropriate for the secure cloud storage systems domain regarding the number of file keys. In that research area TF-DAC-MACS revealed as the most suitable candidate which finally satisfies all the requirements and provides acceptable scalability. 

In comparison to the classical rekeying scheme better performance on en- and decryption is expected when scaling up the number of clients. It further have to be noticed that the performance improvements of ABE in comparison to RSA depend surely on the selected use case. If group will be formed that can be described completely by a low number of attributes ABE will be more efficient. However, if groups are created that can not easily be described by a low number of attributes, ABE will perform with the same overhead as the current scheme. 

Whether this assumption holds true in practice and if the day-to-day use cases of the user are sufficient to provide the promised performance boost will be evaluated in the following sections.
